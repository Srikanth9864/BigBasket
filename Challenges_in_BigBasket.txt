1. When i was trying to findout xpath for a particular element, I could inspect the element
but when i move mouse cursor from the webelement it changes the element code in Html page 

Ans: I tried to inspect column containing webelements and derived the xpath of column and then navigated to particular webelement

2. When i was trying to find xpath for non html tag web element, the tag doesn't work for the web element.

Ans: By doing some research i got to know we can find xpath for a web element which has non-html tag with 

	syntax--"//*[local-name()='non-html tag name' and @attribute = 'value']"
